# Insurance-Cost-Analysis
## Overview
#### This project analyses a medical insurance dataset to explore how health and lifestyle factors affect insurance costs. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical tests, and used regression analysis to explore relationships between features and insurance costs, identifying which factors are most strongly associated with higher charges.
